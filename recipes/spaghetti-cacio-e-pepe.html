        <p>This spaghetti cacio e pepe recipe has been made in our family for many years, and everyone loves it. It is a very basic and easy variation on mac and cheese.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups grated pecorino romano cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1 cup cooking water, then drain spaghetti.
            </li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic and pepper in hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cooked spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Stir in more cooking water as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, until sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.
